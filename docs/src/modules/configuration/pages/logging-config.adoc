Karate logging configuration file (`logback-test.xml`) is located in the `src/test/resources` folder. The default configuration is as follows:

* The log output is to the console and to a file.
** `target/karate.log`
* The log level for the `com.intuit.karate` and `{karatetools-package}` packages is set to `INFO`.
* The log level for the root logger is set to `INFO`.

NOTE: If the log level for `com.intuit.karate` is changed to debug, Karate will show/log all the requests and responses. This setting must be used only for debugging purposes as it will generate a lot of output.

When Karate Tools Authentication fails it can be identified through the karate logs and the karate reports.

For example:

image::auth-error-example.png[role="no-border, zoom-in"]


* `invalid authMode`:
+
[source,log,subs="+attributes"]
----
>> auth >> Trying to authenticate with no authMode or invalid authMode. auth.authMode:BASIC
----

* `no username`:
+
[source,log,subs="+attributes"]
----
>> auth >> Trying to authenticate with no username. auth.authMode:basic auth.username:null
----

* `no password`:
+
[source,log,subs="+attributes"]
----
>> auth >> Trying to authenticate with no password. auth.authMode:basic auth.username:username100 auth.password:undefined
----

IMPORTANT: The specific error messages for each supported authentication type are defined in the corresponding section.

> What is Archetype?
> In short, Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit. An archetype is defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made.

The `karatetools-oss-archetype` module povides the templates and scripts to generate *karate-test* modules.

This module has the following structure:

.Karate Tools Archetype Overview
[plantuml,development-guide-karatetools-oss-arquetype,png,role="no-border, zoom-in"]
....
include::puml:partial$karatetools-oss-archetype.puml[]
....

It includes the following files:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::example$archetype-tree.txt[]
----
include::example$archetype-tree-callouts.txt[]

IMPORTANT: Any changes made in the prototype files and/or processing scripts must be reflected in the corresponding output project tests.

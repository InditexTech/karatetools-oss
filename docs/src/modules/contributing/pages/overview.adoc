This guide is intended to explain the process of *implementing new features* or *fixing bugs* in the Karate Tools Ecosystem.

The steps to follow are:

* *Implement* the new *feature* or *fix* the *bug*
* Perform the necessary tests
** Create or Update the corresponding *unit tests*, execute them and verify that they pass and that the *code coverage* is over the established threshold *{karatetools-unit-coverage-threshold}*
** Execute the *mutation tests*, verify that they pass and that the *mutation coverage* is over the established threshold *{karatetools-mutation-coverage-threshold}*
** Create or Update the corresponding *integration tests*, execute them and verify that they pass and that the *code coverage* is over the established threshold *{karatetools-integration-coverage-threshold}*
** Create or Update the corresponding *karate tests*, execute them and verify that they pass and that the *code coverage* is over the established threshold *{karatetools-karate-coverage-threshold}*
* Update the relevant *documentation*

The following sections will describe the *code structure*, to be able to *find easily the location of the code to be added or modified*, how to *execute and verify the tests* and how to *update the documentation*.

At the end of the guide, you will find a *step-by-step guide* that will help you to follow the process of *implementing new features* or *fixing bugs* for the Karate Tools.
